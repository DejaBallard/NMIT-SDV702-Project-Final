Date Finished: 24 June 2019

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project was request by Matthias Otto as part of my SDV701 Course at NMIT. The purpose of this Assessment is to demostrate the use of understanding principles of tiered application design
I was tasked with creating applications that interact with a server.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
My Scenario is a jewellery company called DesignB, which sells products. <br>
Company has a consumer application which allows them to search through products and purchase items.<br>
It also has an Admin application which allows for employees to add edit, add and delete stock and also edit and delete orders.<br>
Both applications communicate with a API controller i created which talks to a server and then passes that information to the database.<br>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

1. MySQL installed
2. Must have DesignB_Server_CLI open before running the other programs

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

1. Before running the server. Open up the App.config file under the DesignB_Server_CLI project and edit the connection string to match your MySQL details
2. Run DesignB_Server_CLI program and it will fail, however if all your details are correct. The error will just say the database does not exist
3. Press 1 and it will create the database
4. Enjoy!
